# AnkiCardTable
Algorithm (sort of)
Sort word list alphabetically (if it isn't) Catagorize words by start letter activate letters on letter bar that have words/inactivate letters that don't

Load a fixed number of words create list and display if card is marked for hiding, remove card from list save list state (and maintain source list) allow 'fliping' through 'pages' of cards

Code base:
JS?
Biggist issue here is I am actually quite clunky with js

GUI:
HTML?
The js issue will hold me back
